# concordance_sys
A text-based concordance system in c and python with strict input parameters.

All files take a specified input given in the folder with exclusion words and lines to index.
Then returns a indexed output file with all indexed words capitalized.

This repository has two versions:

Version 1: indexes lines and returns them

Version 2: indexes lines, then indents/trims them and returns them through stdout or an output file.
